= Deployment Reporter

== Installation

Put in $MAVEN_HOME/lib/ext:

- deployment-reporter-maven-plugin-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
- geronimo-json_1.1_spec-1.0.jar
- geronimo-jsonb_1.0_spec-1.0.jar
- johnzon-core-1.1.7.jar
- johnzon-jsonb-1.1.7.jar
- johnzon-mapper-1.1.7.jar

== Run

Run your build (optionally you can set where to output the report using `-Ddeployment-reporter.output=/path/to/report.json`).

By default report is dumped when the maven session ends and it uses the maven logger.
